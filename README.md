Goal:
The aim of this project was to analyze over 4,000 Kickstarter projects in order to gain insights as to what makes a project succesful and to answer additional questions like:

1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

Process Employed:

Used conditional formatting to highlight projects that match a criteria

Pivot table for summarizing data, pivot charts,line charts for disaplying the data visually.

Formulas for performing arithmetic operations like sum,average,percentage,etc.

Used quartiles and box plot to determine outliers in the dataset

The Report.docx file has the answers to the questions that I hoped to answer.
